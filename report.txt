Hello,
 
 This mail documents the attempt made to reproduce the malfunction found during multiple session of switches upgrades on [DATE]. To the attempts a script was used to trigger a link failure on the [SWITCH_MODEL] Nexus switches by implementing systematic interface bouncing with connectivity validation, also reboots have been done and a Downgrade/upgrade in a desperate attempt to recreate the malfunction. 
 
 TLDR: It didn't work, failed to reproduce the malfunction previously found.
 
 Please refer to the case SR [CASE_NUMBER] to see the malfunction found during the upgrades.
 
 Script functionality:
 
 1째 Interface bouncing : Shut/No shut, wait [WAIT_TIME] sec to not trigger Link flapping
 2째 Monitor Interface Status : Waits till the interface to be Connected
 3째 Pings [TARGET_IP] through the interface to check if the malfunction is present 
 4째 Repeats indefinitly 
 
 Testing:
 
 Phase 1 : LAB 
 The Lab test was conducted with [NUMBER] different switches ([SWITCH_IDS]) and the script completed over [LAB_CYCLES] cycles without tigger the malfunction. 
 
 Phase 2 : Prod
 The script was lunched in switch [PROD_SWITCH_ID] were the malfunction was detected during an upgrade, it completed over [PROD_CYCLES] cycles without trigger the malfunction.
 
 Phase 3: Prod Reboots and (Re)upgrade 
 
 A couple of reboots and a Down/Upgrade was performed. The upgrade was from version [FROM_VERSION] to [TO_VERSION] in the switch same switch of phase 2 without trigger the malfunction. 
 
 
 Conclusion:
 
 In a specific environment with specific switches with a huge some of Shut/No shut it wasn't possible to reproduce the malfunction, the tests were inconclusive due to the lack of results, lack of knowledge about the trigger of the malfunction.
 
 
 If you have any feedback about how to reproduce the malfunction please don't hesitate to contact me even if it's a long shoot I'm happy to try any ideas, the stability of our network depends on it.
 
 Kind Regards
